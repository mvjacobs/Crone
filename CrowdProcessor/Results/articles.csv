""We now have a real whale war on our hands and we have no intention of retreating,"" he said.The group today sent its helicopter out to search for Japan's whale processing ship, while other Sea Shepherd members were frantically removing fuel and other pollutants from the sinking Ady Gil.Australia's deputy prime minister, Julia Gillard, called for calm on both sides while the country's maritime safety authority investigated the collision.","Japan is using scientific research as an excuse to conduct commercial whaling in defiance of an international ban, Australia said on Wednesday at the start of a landmark legal bid to put a permanent end to the annual slaughter of almost 1,000 whales in the Southern Ocean.Australia, with the support of New Zealand, has asked the International Court of Justice to withdraw all permits for future whale hunts from the Japanese fleet.The hearings in the Hague will last three weeks and a decision is expected before the end of the year, possibly in time to halt Japan's next whaling expedition. The decision by the top UN court will be final, as there is no appeals process."

The marine conservation group Sea Shepherd has scored a propaganda victory over Japan after it emerged it had bought its newest anti-whaling vessel from the Japanese government, apparently without its knowledge.The $2m dollar vessel, which previously belonged to the country's meteorological agency, was bought from unsuspecting Japanese authorities by a US company, re-registered in the Pacific island of Tuvalu as the New Atlantis, and delivered to Australia by a Japanese crew.The ship, which was unveiled on Tuesday in Hobart, was reflagged to Australia and named after Sam Simon, the founding producer of The Simpsons TV series and a prominent animal rights campaigner.It is the newest addition to a fleet of four Sea Shepherd vessels that is expected to pursue Japan's whalers soon after they leave for the Antarctic later this month.
